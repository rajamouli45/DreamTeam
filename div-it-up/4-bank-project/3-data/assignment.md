# Refactor and comment your code

## Instructions

As your codebase grows, it's important to refactor your code frequently to keep it readable and maintainable over time. Add comments and refactor your `app.js` to improve the code quality:

- Extract constants, like the server API base URL
- Factorize similar code: for example you can create a `sendRequest()` function to regroup the code used in both `createAccount()` and `getAccount()`
- Reorganize the code to make it easier to read, and add comments
