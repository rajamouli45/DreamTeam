# Improve the routing

## Instructions

The routes declaration contains currently only the template ID to use. But when displaying a new page, a bit more is needed sometimes. Let's improve our routing implementation with two additional features:

- Give titles to each template and update the window title with this new title when the template changes.
- Add an option to run some code after the template changes. We want to print `'Dashboard is shown'` in the developer console every time the dashboard page is displayed.
