# Style your bank app

## Instructions

Create a new `styles.css` file and add a link to it in your current `index.html` file. In the CSS file you just created add some styling to make the *Login* and *Dashboard* page looks nice and tidy. Try to create a color theme to give your app its own branding.

> Tip: you can modify the HTML and add new elements and classes if needed.
