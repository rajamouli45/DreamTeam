# Practice your HTML: Build a blog mockup

## Instructions

Imagine you are designing, or redesigning, your personal web site. Create a graphical mockup of your site, and then write down the HTML markup you would use to build out the various elements of the site. You can use software of your choice, just make sure to hand-code the HTML markup. (Just a simple design is enough)
